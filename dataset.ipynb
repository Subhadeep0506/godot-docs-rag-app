Once you kinda really truly realize that, its like, not as big a deal? It still stings, but you just learn to expect edgy insecure ppl on the internet to exist and then youre mentally ready for it. I got trolled on tiktok  and twitch plenty for doing art, by ppl who couldnt even draw. My counter to this was to ignore them like bratty kids... when you behave, you get my attention. So I'd say that to you as well, for your mental health and the health of your channel and community, make a note to really highlight the positive comments, bring them up in future videos even, displayed on screen. Literally just ignore this stuff.(publicly, because of course internally you will feel it regardless) The BEST outcome for trolls and bullies is a response, even negative. hell...they WANT the fight... the WORST outcome to them is speaking into a void where they feel unheard and then seeing the positive comments getting noticed and praised.\n",

      "dude this isn't an AITA moment, you're not even wrong. I do understand where you're coming from, but you're really not supposed to feel bad about helping beginners. I mean i started off godot by watching garbaj tutorials, but i now realize how simplified they are, and how basic the setups are, and though the tutorials aren't meant to be used in commercial games or anything, they're still worth gold, because they can introduce you to the daunting subject that is game dev and start off nice and easy. if someone who used the game engine for a while doesn't understand that then they just forgot who they were x years ago, when they first started game dev' metadata={'author': Redditor(name='xCosmicRaiderx'), 'score': 162, 'upvote_ratio': 0.84, 'num_comments': 86}\n",
